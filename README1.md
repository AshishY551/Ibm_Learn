Document retrieval system

A document retrieval system is designed to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve documents based on user queries. It utilizes various algorithms and techniques to index and search through large volumes of text, ensuring that relevant documents are quickly accessible. These systems often incorporate natural language processing (NLP) to understand and interpret the context of queries, enhancing the accuracy of search results. By leveraging machine learning models, document retrieval systems can continuously improve their performance, adapting to user preferences and evolving data patterns.

1.
Document processing involves handling documents from various sources, parsing and transforming them into usable formats and store them in vector databases. For example, you can download PDF documents and process them to obtain the text and images and then generate descriptions of images.

2.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models (LLMs), such as IBM’s Granite, by connecting them to external knowledge bases. This approach allows LLMs to access up-to-date and domain-specific information beyond their training data, without requiring fine-tuning. RAG is particularly effective for generating insightful and contextually relevant responses. While traditional RAG implementations are primarily focused on text-based applications—such as summarization and conversational agents—emerging use cases are expanding its potential across multimodal and enterprise scenarios.

3.

LangChain can be used to streamline and orchestrate document processing and retrieval workflows, enabling seamless integration and coordination between various components of the system.
